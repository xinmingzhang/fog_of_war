# Fog of War

this file is for [Reddit Pygame Challenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/pygame/comments/4u8iht/challenge_fog_of_war/)
I really love this challenge, because my first computer game is Age of Empires when I am in senior school in 2000. And also I can remember that my mom spent more than 6000 RMB to buy the computer, she thought I shouldn't be behind the times. But sadly, most of the time I use computer to play games( Age of Empires II & Tomb Raider II) ^ v ^.

  - run main.py
  - I have tested it in Python 3 and Python 2


I am not good at deal with sprite.group, especially the sprite layer, it is seemed that sprite._layer controls the blit order. But this challenge created the footprint property to control the layer, but I am quite worried about the sprite pos, because I think if you change the footprint, the pos would be changed, am i right?. So if you have any guidance, please tell me and i would be very glad ^ v ^
